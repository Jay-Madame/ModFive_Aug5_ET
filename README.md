__Objectives:__
[ ] Create a class called EvenEater.  <br/>
    - [ ] EvenEater should have a public Exception class: OddFoodException.<br/>
    - [ ] EvenEater should have a single public function string eat(int num);<br/>
        - [ ] The eat function should test whether the num is even.  If it is, return a string "Yum!"<br/>
        - [ ] If it is not, an OddFoodException should be thrown.<br/>
<br/>
[ ] The main function should create an EvenEater object, and then (in a loop, continuously) prompt the user for a number.<br/>
[ ] Pass the number to the EvenEater.  <br/>
[ ] Return the EvenEater's reaction to the user.  <br/>
    - [ ] If the EvenEater throws an exception, print out an appropriate message and get a different value from the user.<br/>
